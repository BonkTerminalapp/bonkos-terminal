# Contributing to Terminal of BONK

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Terminal of BONK! This guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/terminal-of-bonk.git
   cd terminal-of-bonk
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up environment variables** (copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values)
5. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code patterns and structure
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### BONK Theme Guidelines
- All content should maintain the BONK theme and energy
- Use hammer (ðŸ”¨) emojis instead of other symbols where appropriate
- Keep the chaotic, high-energy personality consistent
- ASCII art should be BONK-themed or related to blockchain/crypto

### Adding New Commands
1. Add your command to `client/src/lib/terminal-commands.ts`
2. Follow the existing pattern:
   ```typescript
   "your-command": async (cryptoData?: CryptoData) => {
     return "\r\n" + colorText("Your output here", "color") + "\r\n";
   }
   ```
3. Update the help system if needed
4. Test your command thoroughly

### Adding New API Endpoints
1. Add endpoints to `server/routes.ts`
2. Follow RESTful patterns
3. Include proper error handling
4. Validate input data with Zod schemas

### Security Considerations
- Never commit API keys, private keys, or sensitive data
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow security best practices for wallet operations

## Testing

- Test your changes thoroughly before submitting
- Ensure the terminal interface works on both desktop and mobile
- Test with and without API keys configured
- Verify wallet operations work correctly
